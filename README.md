**Employed Developer Syndrome (EDS)**: a phenomenon where a programmer has less than 5 public repositories dedicated to their passion (personal) projects with the primary language they use or they make a living out of.

**Algorithms Junkie Syndrome (AJS)**: a condition where a programmer of any age group has 90% of their public repositories dedicated to solving LeetCode specifically with Python.

**Failed Startups Syndrome (FSS)**: a common problem of leaving too many unfinished projects hanging because of not committing to one business idea a programmerâ€™s friend or family suggested.
